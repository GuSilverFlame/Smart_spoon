this repo is for the arduino code of our completion of course work
the SMAAAART SPOOOON

## DEPENDENCIES ##
none, until I find a new library for i2c

### Contribution guidelines ###
keep commits baby steps(small changes for each commit, no huge commits unless all the code changes are completely interdependent)
and make the messages good enough to explain what the change was meant for
